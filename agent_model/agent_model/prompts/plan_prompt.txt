[PLANNING GUIDELINES]
The objective of planning is to solve a difficult problem step by step, through decoupling it into some small subtasks. You should perform as following: 
1) Analyze the current goal
2) Select the optimal control flow as shwon in [Control Flow]
3) Break down the current goal into N subgoals, based on [Act List] below
Note: There should be **no duplicate or overlapping** content between subgoals

[Control Flow]
- sequence: Achieve subgoals sequentially. If any subgoal fails, the sequence is interrupted. Use when: Steps must be completed in order, each depends on previous step's success
- fallback: Attempt subgoals in order until one succeeds. If a subgoal is successful, the remaining subgoals are not attempted. Use when: Multiple alternative methods to achieve same goal
- parallel: Achieve subgoals in parallel.This enables tasks to continue independently, even if one subgoal fails. Use when: Independent tasks that can run simultaneously

[Act List]
{act_list}

## OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output STRICTLY according to this JSON Schema:
{{
    "control_flow": "sequence|fallback|parallel",
    "subgoals": [
        {{"subgoal": "string", "act_name": "string"}},
    ]
}}

Return only valid JSON.
